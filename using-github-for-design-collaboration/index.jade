            p I haven’t been giving GitHub enough credit. The power of collaboration, even for a design project like this, is truly magical.
            p I’ve worked on a couple of design teams. Many of them weren’t really collaborative. It’s not their fault. The fact is, that Photoshop and Fireworks<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> files don’t lend themselves for collaboration. And to be honest, most of us Designers hate it when you touch our files.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>
            p However, with Open Source Design, we’re tossing these old ways to the side and trying something new, and that’s where GitHub issues come into play.

            p I’ve only been working on this project for three weeks, and you should see how many issues we already have open, and how many people are giving their two cents. We’re talking about <a href="https://github.com/opensourcedesignis/opensourcedesignis.github.io/issues/33">branding the project</a>, <a href="https://github.com/opensourcedesignis/opensourcedesignis.github.io/issues/25">editorial</a> <a href="https://github.com/opensourcedesignis/opensourcedesignis.github.io/issues/35">ideas</a>, <a href="https://github.com/opensourcedesignis/opensourcedesignis.github.io/issues/29">conferences we can present at</a>, and a <a href="https://github.com/opensourcedesignis/opensourcedesignis.github.io/issues/14">whole</a> <a href="https://github.com/opensourcedesignis/opensourcedesignis.github.io/issues/10">lot</a> <a href="https://github.com/opensourcedesignis/opensourcedesignis.github.io/issues/19">more</a>. It’s amazing. What’s even better is that ideas begin rough, and together with the other smart people working on the project, the ideas evolve and turn into diamonds.
            p And that’s what this is all about. It doesn’t matter who you are, how much experience you have, nothing. You can contribute and collaborate on this project, because we’re all learning together. With so many minds working together, the possibilities are endless.
            p If you want to get involved, please do! Even if you don’t feel comfortable pushing code, we’d love to see more people in the issue comments.
